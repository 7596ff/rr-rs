# rr-rs

This is an ever-evolving fourth rewrite of rohrkatze-rotator, this time in Rust. It is my second
Rust project, and I am writing it to learn about lots of Rust concepts, mostly asynchronous
programming. It (will soon) replicate all functionality of the JS edition of the bot, and then
supplant it.

Even though the source code to the bot is in the public domain, I strongly advise you not to run it
yourself, as there is considerable background maintenance that is required. You can invite the bot
to your server with [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=254387001556598785&permissions=268435488&scope=bot).
