**Information**
Prefix: `katze`

Arguments with <> should be replaced with user input. Arguments with [] around them are optional. Some commands require a role. If the server has no role set, they can be used by everyone. However, once a role is set, the command is restricted to users with that role, even if they are an administrator.Some commands require the user to be a server administrator. This is determined by whether or not they have the permission `MANAGE_GUILD`.

**Examples**
`katze rotate`
`katze pick 2134982639478342`
`katze pick "this first" "this second?" third`
